        "\n",
        "The task of predicting an individual's income level is an important one with far-reaching implications. In various fields such as marketing, taxation, and public policy, being able to predict income can help tailor interventions, advertisements, and policies to the right audience. More specifically, predicting whether an individual's annual income exceeds $50,000, or remains below or equal to that threshold, can be useful for resource allocation, financial services, or employment-related decision-making.\n",
        "\n",
        "In this scenario, we are given a dataset containing demographic and employment-related features of individuals. The goal is to use **Random Forests**, a powerful machine learning algorithm, to predict whether an individual's income exceeds $50,000 annually. This is a **binary classification** problem where the target variable is income, which is represented as either <=50K or >50K."

        "- Loading the dataset using `pandas.read_csv()`.\n",
        "- Replacing missing values (represented as `?`) with `NaN` for easier handling.\n",
